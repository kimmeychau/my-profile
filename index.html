				Hi my name is Kim Mey but everyone calls me Kim because it's easier to remember... So you can call me Kim or Kim Mey, both are fine with me. I'm 18 and I'll be 19 in October. I was born in Cambodia but I've been living in France for 17 years now so it's almost as if I was born in France. I'm a first year student at Essec Business school in the Global BBA program in the english track. Oh and I am the president of a club called Essec Japon.

			<h3> Art üé® </h3>
			<p>  
				I love art : I love paintings, drawings, sculptures and everything that is beautiful to watch. I love to visit museums so if you need a buddy to visit some museums with you... text me, I'm always down !! I really like to draw or paint because it stimulates my creativity... now if you ask me if my works of art are beautiful... yeah, next question. I have no time to practice so my drawins and paintings are ugly. Oh, and I love to go to the theater to watch plays.

			<h3> Music üéµ</h3>
			<p>
				I'm fond of music, I really enjoy listening to music. You'll almost always see me with earphones in my ears. Recently, I feel like I'm going deaf... I think it's a sign for me to stop listening to music all day, it's not good for my ears. Anyway, I like (almost) all kind of music, I like classical music, rap, rnb and pop. My favorite instrument is probably the piano. Yeah I know it's not original but I really like how relaxing and graceful it sounds.

			<h3> Learn new things üîç </h3>
			<p>
				Yes, one of my hobbies is to learn new things. Does that mean I have a lot of culture ? No, my memory is short. üíÄ But I really enjoy talking and debating about many different things with people. I also find it attractive when someone teach me things I didn't know before. I am really talkative and open-minded so feel free to talk about anything you want with me !
